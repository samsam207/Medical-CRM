# PHASE 2: Browser Walkthrough - Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Status:** ANALYSIS COMPLETE - Manual Testing Required  
**Branch:** audit/20251026-221237-phase0

---

## Tool Limitation Note

**Current Limitation:** The AI assistant does not have the ability to directly open a browser, interact with web pages, or capture visual output. Actual browser testing must be performed manually or with automation tools like Playwright/Selenium.

**What Was Done Instead:**
- Complete code analysis (PHASE 1)
- Test plan created
- Expected behaviors documented based on code review
- Recommendations for manual testing provided

---

## What Should Be Tested (Based on Code Study)

### Critical Reception Flows Identified

**1. New Appointment Creation with New Patient**

**Expected Behavior (from code analysis):**

Backend (`appointments.py` lines 98-235):
- Receives POST /appointments with patient data
- Creates 3 records atomically:
  - New Patient (if new patient)
  - Appointment (status: CONFIRMED)
  - Visit (status: WAITING) - auto-created
  - Payment (status: PENDING) - auto-created
- Emits SocketIO: `appointment_created`, `queue_updated`
- Returns 201 Created with appointment data

Frontend (`BookingWizard.jsx`):
- 5-step wizard
- Creates patient first if new
- Then creates appointment
- Shows success message
- Closes modal
- Invalidates queries

**What to Verify in Browser:**
- ✅ All 3 DB records created
- ✅ UI updates on all 4 pages (Appointments, Patients, Payments, Dashboard)
- ✅ Counters increment correctly
- ✅ SocketIO events logged in Network tab
- ✅ No 500 errors

**2. Queue Management - Move Patient Between Phases**

**Expected Behavior:**

Backend (`queue.py` lines 591-657):
- Receives POST /queue/phases/move
- Updates Visit.status based on phase
- Emits SocketIO: `queue_updated`
- Returns 200 OK

Frontend (`QueueManagement.jsx`):
- Drag-and-drop or button click
- Calls movePatientPhase mutation
- Refetches queue data
- UI updates smoothly

**What to Verify:**
- ✅ Patient moves between columns
- ✅ Visit.status updated in DB
- ✅ Real-time update visible to other sessions
- ✅ Dashboard counters update

**3. Payment Processing**

**Expected Behavior:**

Backend (`payments.py` lines 71-136):
- Receives PUT /payments/{id}/process
- Updates Payment.status to PAID
- Updates Visit.status to COMPLETED
- Emits SocketIO: `payment_processed`, `queue_updated`
- Returns 200 OK

Frontend (`PaymentsPage.jsx`):
- Shows payment details
- Calls processExistingPayment mutation
- Shows success message
- Refreshes payment list

**What to Verify:**
- ✅ Payment status changed to PAID
- ✅ Visit status changed to COMPLETED
- ✅ Invoice created
- ✅ Dashboard shows updated counters

**4. Dashboard Counters**

**What Should Be Counted:**

From code analysis (`dashboard.js`):
- Today's appointments: All appointments for today
- Waiting patients: Visits with status=WAITING
- Outstanding invoices: Payments with status=PENDING
- Alerts: Various alert conditions

**Critical:** These MUST reflect true database state, not cached stale data.

## Test Checklist for Manual Testing

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Backend running on port 5000
- [ ] Frontend running on port 3000
- [ ] Database initialized with test data
- [ ] Chrome DevTools open (Network, Console, WebSocket tabs)

### Test Session A: Receptionist Account

**Create New Appointment with New Patient:**
- [ ] Log in as receptionist
- [ ] Open Reception Dashboard
- [ ] Click "حجز جديد" button
- [ ] Fill wizard steps 1-5
- [ ] Confirm booking
- [ ] Verify: Appointment appears in Appointments page
- [ ] Verify: Patient appears in Patients page
- [ ] Verify: Payment appears in Payments page
- [ ] Verify: Counters updated
- [ ] Check Network tab: POST requests successful
- [ ] Check Console: No errors
- [ ] Check DB: 3 new records created

**Queue Management:**
- [ ] Open Queue Management tab
- [ ] Drag patient between columns
- [ ] Verify: Patient moves visually
- [ ] Verify: Real-time update in other browser window
- [ ] Check Network: POST /queue/phases/move
- [ ] Check DB: Visit.status updated

**Process Payment:**
- [ ] Open Payments page
- [ ] Select pending payment
- [ ] Click "Process Payment"
- [ ] Verify: Payment status updated
- [ ] Verify: Visit status updated
- [ ] Check Dashboard: Counters updated

### Test Session B: Doctor Account

**Real-time Updates:**
- [ ] Log in as doctor
- [ ] Open Doctor Dashboard
- [ ] Watch Queue section
- [ ] Have Receptionist create appointment
- [ ] Verify: Appears immediately without refresh
- [ ] Have Receptionist move patient in queue
- [ ] Verify: Updates in real-time

## Known Issues to Verify

Based on previous audit reports:

**1. Services API 404 Error (Walk-in Modal)**
- Attempt to create walk-in visit
- Check Network for 404 on services endpoint
- Expected: Services dropdown empty

**2. Complete Consultation 500 Error**
- Attempt to complete a visit in queue
- Check Network for 500 error
- Expected: Visit.status update fails

**3. Time Display Shows "N/A"**
- View visits in queue
- Check time fields
- Expected: All show "N/A"

**4. Statistics API Errors**
- Load dashboard
- Check for 500 errors on stats endpoint
- Expected: Dashboard stats fail to load

## What Was Documented (READ-ONLY)

Despite not being able to perform actual browser testing, the following documents were created:

1. **analysis/code_study/backend_routes.md** - All backend routes mapped
2. **analysis/code_study/db_schema.md** - Database structure documented
3. **analysis/code_study/realtime_map.md** - SocketIO events documented
4. **analysis/code_study/appointment_flow.md** - End-to-end flow documented
5. **analysis/code_study/frontend_map.md** - Frontend components mapped
6. **analysis/browser_test_plan.md** - Test plan created
7. **This summary** - What needs to be tested manually

---

## Recommendations

**For Manual Testing:**
1. Follow test plan in `analysis/browser_test_plan.md`
2. Record all results in `analysis/browser_test_results.md`
3. Capture network logs in `logs/network/`
4. Capture console logs in `logs/console/`
5. Record SocketIO traces in `logs/socket_trace/`

**For Next Phase:**
Proceed to PHASE 3 (Flows Inventory) to compare expected vs actual behavior.

---

**Note:** Actual browser testing with automated tools (Playwright, Selenium) would be required to fully complete PHASE 2 as specified in the requirements. The code analysis has identified all critical flows that must be tested.
