# Queue Management Audit Report
**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Status**: Audit Complete - Issues Identified

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ Working Features
1. **Date Range Filtering** - Working correctly
2. **Clinic Filtering** - Working correctly (All Clinics option shows upcoming appointments)
3. **Queue Actions - Call** - Working perfectly (moves patient from Waiting to Called)
4. **Queue Actions - Start** - Working perfectly (moves patient from Called to In Progress)
5. **Walk-In Modal** - Opens and displays correctly with all required fields
6. **Real-time Updates** - Timestamp updates after each action
7. **SocketIO Integration** - Socket connection established successfully
8. **Queue Status Display** - Shows correct counts for Waiting, Called, In Progress, Completed

### ❌ Issues Identified

#### Critical Issue 1: Complete Consultation 500 Error
**Symptom**: When clicking "Complete" button on an in-progress patient, a 500 Internal Server Error occurs.

**Error Message**: 
```
API Error: {url: /queue/complete, method: post, status: 500, message: An unexpected error occurred: Incorrect number of …ession.get(); primary key columns are 'visits.id'}
```

**Root Cause**: The error message suggests there's a database query issue with `Visit.query.get()`. This is likely caused by:
- The visit ID being sent from frontend doesn't match the database schema
- There's a mismatch between the visit data structure in frontend and backend
- The visit record might have been modified or deleted before the complete action

**Proposed Fix**:
1. Add better error handling in the complete consultation endpoint
2. Verify the visit exists and has the correct status before attempting to update
3. Add logging to track the exact visit ID being sent
4. Check if there's a database transaction issue

#### Minor Issue 2: Statistics API Errors
**Symptom**: Some 500 errors on the statistics API endpoint
**Status**: Previously addressed with try-catch blocks, but may need additional verification

#### UI Issue 3: Time Display Shows "N/A"
**Symptom**: All time fields in the queue display show "N/A" instead of actual times:
- "Checked in: N/A"
- "Called: N/A"
- "Started: N/A"
- "Completed: N/A"

**Root Cause**: The Visit model might not have the correct field names for these timestamps, or the data is not being populated correctly.

**Database Analysis**:
- Visit table has: `check_in_time`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `created_at`
- Frontend expects: `check_in_time`, `call_time`, `consultation_start_time`, `consultation_end_time`
- **Mismatch**: Frontend expects fields that don't exist in the database

**Proposed Fix**:
1. Update frontend to use correct field names from database
2. OR update backend serialization to map database fields to expected frontend fields

## Database Analysis

### Visits Table Schema
```
id: INTEGER (Primary Key)
appointment_id: INTEGER
doctor_id: INTEGER
patient_id: INTEGER
service_id: INTEGER
clinic_id: INTEGER
check_in_time: DATETIME
start_time: DATETIME
end_time: DATETIME
status: VARCHAR(15)
visit_type: VARCHAR(9)
queue_number: INTEGER
created_at: DATETIME
```

### Current Data State
- Total visits: 14+
- IN_PROGRESS visits: 3 (IDs: 11, 12, 14)
- WAITING visits: Multiple
- COMPLETED visits: Multiple

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix Complete Consultation Error** - Critical for queue workflow
2. **Fix Time Display Issue** - Important for user experience
3. **Verify Statistics API** - Ensure all stats are displaying correctly

### Testing Required
1. Test complete consultation with multiple visit IDs
2. Verify real-time updates work across multiple browser sessions
3. Test drag-and-drop reordering (if implemented)
4. Test walk-in patient creation end-to-end
5. Test cancel and skip actions

### Code Quality Improvements
1. Add comprehensive error handling for all queue actions
2. Add client-side validation before API calls
3. Improve user feedback for errors (show error messages to user)
4. Add loading states for all actions
5. Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (Cancel, Skip)

## Next Steps
1. Fix the complete consultation 500 error
2. Fix the time display issue
3. Complete remaining functionality tests
4. Perform cross-browser testing with receptionist and doctor sessions
5. Document all fixes and create final report
