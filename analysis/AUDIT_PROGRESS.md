# Medical CRM Reception Dashboard Audit - Progress Report

## Phase 1: Environment Setup & Database Verification ✅ COMPLETE

### Completed Actions:
1. Reset database using `db.drop_all()` and `db.create_all()`
2. Seed database with initial data (users, clinics, doctors, patients, services, appointments, visits, payments)
3. Verified database schema matches model definitions
4. Started backend and frontend servers

### Issues Found & Fixed:
1. **Visit Model Issue**: Custom `__init__` method was blocking SQLAlchemy's proper object instantiation
   - **Fix**: Removed custom `__init__` method to allow SQLAlchemy to handle object creation properly
   - **File Modified**: `backend/app/models/visit.py`

2. **CORS Configuration Issue**: SocketIO and CORS only allowed `http://localhost:3000` but frontend is running on port 3002
   - **Fix**: Added multiple allowed origins including ports 3000, 3001, 3002, and 5173
   - **File Modified**: `backend/app/__init__.py`
   - **Lines Modified**: 62 (socketio CORS) and 67 (CORS allowed origins)

## Phase 2: Authentication & State Management Testing ⏳ IN PROGRESS

### Completed Actions:
1. ✅ Successfully logged in as receptionist (`sara_reception` / `sara123`)
2. ✅ Dashboard loads with stats showing:
   - 5 appointments today
   - 0 waiting patients
   - 1 pending payment
   - 3 alerts
3. ⚠️ Socket.IO connection failing
4. ⚠️ Dashboard stats API returning 500 error

### Issues Found:
1. **Socket.IO Connection Failure**: WebSocket connection to `ws://localhost:5000/socket.io/` is failing
   - This is preventing real-time updates
   - Might be related to backend server not fully supporting WebSocket protocol

2. **Dashboard Stats API Error**: Returning 500 Internal Server Error
   - Need to check backend logs for specific error

### Current Status:
- ✅ Login works
- ✅ Dashboard displays (with some data)
- ❌ Socket.IO connection failing
- ❌ Dashboard stats API returning error

### Next Steps:
1. Check backend logs for Socket.IO and stats API errors
2. Fix Socket.IO connection issue
3. Fix dashboard stats API error
4. Continue testing appointment booking flow

## Server Status:
- **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:5000 (with auto-reload)
- **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:3002
- **Login Credentials**: `sara_reception` / `sara123`
