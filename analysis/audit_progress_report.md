# Medical CRM Audit Progress Report

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

---

## Summary

Started comprehensive audit of Medical CRM system. Discovered and fixed critical dashboard statistics bug.

---

## Bugs Found and Fixed

### Bug #1: Dashboard Statistics 500 Error ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Dashboard fails to load, entire reception workflow blocked

**Root Cause:**
- Dashboard statistics queries used `JOIN Appointment` to count visits
- Walk-in visits have no linked appointment (appointment_id is NULL)
- This caused SQL errors when trying to join with Appointment

**Solution:**
- Changed visit counting to use `Visit.created_at` instead of joining with Appointment
- Fixed both `get_receptionist_stats()` and `get_doctor_stats()` functions
- Now correctly counts both scheduled visits (with appointments) and walk-ins (without appointments)

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/app/routes/dashboard.py` (lines 77-95, 176-204)

**Code Changes:**
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
today_visits = db.session.query(Visit).join(Appointment).filter(
    Visit.clinic_id == clinic_id,
    db.func.date(Appointment.start_time) == date
).count()

# AFTER (FIXED):
today_visits = db.session.query(Visit).filter(
    db.func.date(Visit.created_at) == date
).count()
```
