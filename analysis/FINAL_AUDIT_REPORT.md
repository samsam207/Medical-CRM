## Issues Summary

### Critical Issues (High Priority)

#### 1. Socket.IO WebSocket Connection Failing
- **Error**: `WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:5000/socket.io/' failed: 400 BAD REQUEST`
- **Impact**: Real-time updates not working
- **Root Cause**: Likely authentication issue in `handle_connect` handler
- **Files**: `backend/app/socketio_handlers/queue_events.py`
- **Status**: ‚ùå Not Fixed

### Medium Issues

#### 2. Booking Wizard Date Picker Default
- **Problem**: Defaults to today (Sunday, Oct 26, 2025)
- **Impact**: Cannot complete appointment booking for doctors not working Sunday
- **Error**: "Doctor doesn't work on Sunday"
- **Files**: `frontend/src/components/BookingWizard.jsx`
- **Status**: ‚ùå Not Fixed
- **Recommendation**: Set default to next Monday or add warning message

### Low Priority Issues

3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Excessive console.log statements
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Socket reconnection warnings in console

---

## Code Quality Assessment

### ‚úÖ Good Practices Found
- React Query for data fetching
- Proper error handling in API calls
- Loading states in UI
- Clean component structure
- Type safety considerations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
