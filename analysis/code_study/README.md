   - HTTP methods, auth requirements, real-time events
   - Cache strategy

2. **db_schema.md** - Database schema and relationships
   - Core tables: appointments, patients, visits, payments
   - Foreign key relationships map
   - Enums and data types
   - Critical data flows

3. **realtime_map.md** - Socket.IO real-time events documentation
   - Event names, payloads, rooms
   - Frontend listeners
   - Authentication

4. **appointment_flow.md** - End-to-end appointment creation flow
   - Frontend wizard → API call → Backend processing
   - Database transaction (atomic)
   - Real-time updates
   - Success criteria

5. **frontend_map.md** - Frontend components and state management
   - React pages and components
   - React Query usage
   - Zustand stores
   - SocketIO integration
   - Key features

## Key Findings

### Critical Flow: Appointment Creation

**When an appointment is confirmed:**

1. Frontend: User fills BookingWizard → clicks Confirm
2. API: POST /appointments with full data
3. Backend: Creates 3 records atomically:
   - Appointment (status: CONFIRMED)
   - Visit (status: WAITING)
   - Payment (status: PENDING)
4. SocketIO: Emits 'appointment_created' and 'queue_updated'
5. Frontend: Invalidates queries, refreshes dashboard

**This is the PRIMARY FLOW to test!**

### Database Relationships

```
Appointment 1:1 Visit 1:1 Payment
    ↓              ↓              ↓
 Patient      Patient       Patient
```

When appointment is created, ALL THREE tables are updated in a single transaction.

### Real-time Updates

All critical operations emit SocketIO events:
- appointment_created
- queue_updated
- visit_status_changed
- payment_processed

ReceptionDashboard listens to ALL events and debounced-refetches stats.

## Reception Features

**Must Work:**
1. Create appointment → 3 records created atomically
2. Create patient → appears in Patients page
3. Process payment → updates Payment and Visit status
4. Move patient in queue → updates all UI
5. Counters reflect true DB state

**All features use:**
- JWT authentication
- React Query for caching
- SocketIO for real-time updates
- Flask-SQLAlchemy for DB

## Next Steps

**PHASE 2:** Browser walkthrough to test all flows  
**PHASE 3:** Inventory of flows and identify broken/partial  
**PHASE 4:** Root cause diagnosis for issues  
**PHASE 5-7:** Fixes and testing  
**PHASE 8:** Final report

## Files Modified

None - PHASE 1 is READ-ONLY analysis only.
